<h2> <mark> ABOUT </mark><del> ME </del> </h2>


<p> <kbd>hello, </kbd><sub>My</sub> <sup>name</sup> <sub>is</sub> <strong><mark> Cyrus Oranza </mark></strong>, <sub>you</sub> <sup>can</sup> <sub>call</sub> <sup>me</sup> <strong>  Cy  </strong> <small>for short</small>. I am 14 years old, and I lived at Tondo Manila, Solis. I am studying at <strong> Lakan Dula High School </strong> and l am currently a <u><strong> Grade 9 student</u></strong>. <u><strong> I love K-pop  groups </u></strong>, like <u>Twice, New jeans, nmixx, blackpink, lesserafim straykids and etc </u> .<u><strong> Dancing </strong></u>  and <strong> <u> Drawing </u></strong> are two of my are my hobbies. Currently, I am <u> focused on finishing my studies </u> while working toward a peaceful life. I have <u><i>supportive and understanding parents;</i> </u> their names are <u><mark> Olivia  </mark></u> and <u><mark> Guillermo </mark></u>. I also have <u> two siblings;</u> their names are <u><mark> Girlie </mark></u> and <u><mark> Charlie  </mark></u>. We love playing online games and always enjoy bonding together, creating fun memories and strengthening our family connection. And I believe in the motto: <blockquote><em><b><mark><u>"Happiness is not by chance, but by choice." </u></mark></b></em></blockquote><i> It means<u> "Happiness is a result of the choices you make, not random circumstances. It comes from how you choose to respond to life events, how you focus on the positive, and how you prioritize gratitude and happiness. You have the power to create your own happiness through mindset, decisions, and actions, rather than waiting for it" .</u></i> </p>



<p> My favorite dishes are <mark><strong><em><u> adobo and sinigang </u></em></strong></mark>, and for dessert, my favorites are  <mark><strong><em><u> leche flan and halo-halo </u></em></strong></mark>. When it comes to color, my favorites are  <mark><strong><em><u> Purple, Yellow and Blue  </u></em></strong></mark> <u><code> because  Purple, Yellow and Blue often evoke feelings of calm, mystery, and serenity. They can remind one of twilight skies, lavender fields, deep ocean depths, or a starry night over the sea. These colors also bring to mind delicate flowers like violets or bluebells, and the peaceful beauty of a moonlit night reflecting on calm waters</code></u>. <u> What makes me happy is </u> <mark><b><i>engaging in activities I truly enjoy </b></i> and <b><i>spending quality time with my family and friends </b></i></mark>. <u>I find joy in <b>watching classic films,</b> especially those featuring my <i>favorite actors,</i> and <b> exploring new hobbies </b> like <b><del> drawing </b></del> and  <b><del>dancing </b></del> </u>. Interests <del>not only</del> bring me <b>great joy</b> <u>but also help me to <b>relax and feel connected </b>. <small> Chasing my dreams and enjoying them with friends and family makes me really happy and  makes each day</small> <BIG><i> Feel special.</i></BIG></u> </p>



<p> <i>One of the most impressive events from my childhood was <u><mark><b>celebrating special occasions like birthdays and Christmas.</u></mark></b></i> These celebrations were <big><b>filled with joy and excitement,</big></b> bringing the family together for <b>memorable moments.</b> <u><i> <small>Opening gifts, greetings from your family and friends, delicious food, and shared laughter made these events truly unforgettable and meaningful.</u></i> </small></p>



<p> <u> Over the years, <i> my values changed from <b>prioritizing immediate achievements to focusing on long-term growth and personal development. I now emphasize the importance of resilience, empathy, and meaningful connections.</i></b></u> <small><mark>Embracing teamwork and understanding others has changed the way I tackle obstacles and engage with people.</mark></small> </p>



<p> A challenging experience I faced was <strong><mark>balancing schoolwork with extracurricular activities.</strong></mark> It happened because <u>managing multiple responsibilities required careful time management and organization.</u> I tackled these challenges by<em> prioritizing tasks, setting clear goals, and seeking support from teachers and family when needed.<b></em> <mark><big>This approach helped me improve my time management skills and handle stress more effectively.</b></mark></big> </p>



<p> <u>In the future, <mark><em><strong>I plan to achieve personal and professional growth by excelling in my studies and pursuing higher education aligned with my career goals.</u></em></strong></mark> I aim to further develop my skills and hobbies, explore new technologies, and enhance my creativity. <i>Personally, I want to maintain a balanced life by supporting relationships and enjoying activities that make me happy, ultimately aiming for a satisfying and impactful. </i>
